# Literate CoffeeScript Examples

This project is aimed at teaching [Literate CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/#literate) Best Practices by example. CoffeeScript is a very concise language and Literate CoffeeScript helps programmers to structure their programming better. Comments tend to improve readability and maintainability.

It's a project of learning for me as well as for the reader and I'm sure I haven't found a true style yet.
